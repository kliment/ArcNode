Graph classes TO-DO list:
Remove all edge/vertex auto-deletion code (so that Graph represents any subgraph)
Add outdegree function to Graph (size of cut)
Also outweight function (capacity of cut)
Add function to trim a graph to the subgraph it purports to contain (in linear time)
replace node/edge iterators with just returning the actual set, iterator code with new fors
incorporate matrix package; generate adj matrix, incidence list

Far future:
Edmonds algorithm
Planarity test/generate embeddings
Default code for displaying graphs (svg or just a Canvas)
